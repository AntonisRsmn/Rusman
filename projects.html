          <h3>Zepp Discord Bot</h3>
          <p>
            Zepp is a small Discord bot created using JavaScript.
            My goal with it was to become verified on discord and help users
            moderate their servers while having fun with all the extra
            features I added, such as games and music, so you can 
            listen while you chat or play with your friends. You can try
            Zepp through the website at https://zepp.gr.

          <h3>Zepp Website</h3>
          <p>
            I made a website for Zepp, and that's how I started
            with web design and development. It was pretty hard at
            the start because I used to write the code on my phone
            using Replit and seek help on Stack Overflow, but I still
            remember the feeling of happiness when I finished the website.
            As of right now, I bought a new laptop and finally started
            making my portfolio to begin a career in web design and development.
            You can visit the website at https://zepp.gr.
